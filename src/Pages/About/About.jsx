          <p>I'm a junior and a transfer student at the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction Design.
          Originally from San Jose, California, I love exploring new environments that inspire my curiosity and shape my approach to empathetic, creative design.</p>

          <p>Since I was little, I've been passionate about exploring hobbies that spark my creativityâ€”whether it's video editing, art, 
            coding, or design. At the heart of it all is my love for creating.</p>

          <p>When I'm not developing, you'll find me cooking, drawing, or listening to music.
             I also enjoy capturing moments with my digital camera and creating nostalgic edits of my friends.
