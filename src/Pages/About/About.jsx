          <h1>Hi! I'm Shamita <i class="ri-sparkling-fill"></i></h1>
          <div className="para-text">
            <p>I'm an incoming senior at the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction Design.
            Originally from San Jose, California, I love exploring new environments that inspire my curiosity and shape my approach to empathetic, creative design.</p>

            <p>
              Ever since I was little, I've been drawn to creative 
              outlets—video editing, art, coding, and design—all 
              fueled by a love for building and bringing ideas to 
              life. Today, I channel that same passion into web 
              development and UI design through hands-on work 
              in several clubs that inspire me. Being part of <a href='https://ucsddesign.co/' target='_blank'>Design Co</a>, 
              the  <a href='https://www.ds3ucsd.com/' target='_blank'>Data Science Student Society</a>, and <a href='https://acmucsd.com/' target='_blank'>ACM</a> at UC San Diego have shaped my skills
               as a developer, strengthened my eye for design, and taught 
               me how to create digital experiences that make an impact.</p>

            <p>When I'm not developing, you'll find me cooking, drawing, or listening to music.
              I also enjoy capturing moments with my digital camera and creating nostalgic edits of my friends.
